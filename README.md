# Practice Project - Figma Design Clone

This project is a personal practice exercise based on a design I found on **Figma**. **I have no affiliation with the organization, company, or author of the original design**, nor with its intended purpose. This project was developed solely to practice and improve my web development skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building web applications.
- **React**: Library for creating user interfaces.
- **SCSS**: For styling the application.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to replicate a design from scratch as a learning exercise, using modern web development technologies. The implementation and code are entirely my own and do not reflect the original work.

## Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**. It is not intended for commercial use or distribution. All rights to the original design belong to their respective owners, whose identity I do not know.
